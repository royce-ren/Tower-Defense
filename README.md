# Tower-Defense
Video Game Design Project Ohlone College.
This was made in Ohlone College summer class for tower defense game creation. 

I led this group project in middle school by coordinating and participating in all parts of game design, from step by step game strategy and visual design. 
We started by creating pixel by pixel enemies, towers, and castle and finished by coding the framework of the game itself. 

The game is a Windows binary executable file.
